   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to SandyPython's documentation!

Warning
=======

This code has not been thoroughly tested yet, so do **not** use it in anything serious. However, feel free to help test it.

About SandyPython
=================

SandyPython aims to provide a full sandbox that stops the sandboxed code from I/O. It does not aim to stop interpreter crashes.

Features
========

 - Sandboxing
 - Save / load capabillity (though :mod:`sandypython.safe_dill`)
 - Module whitelist
 - Method whitelist for all builtin types
 - Full sphinx documentation at https://rawgit.com/matsjoyce/sandypython/master/doc/build/index.html

Quick start::

    from sandypython import *

    core.add_default_builtins()

    with utils.ActivateSandbox():
        core.exec_str(bad_code)

For a more complete reference, see the docs at https://rawgit.com/matsjoyce/sandypython/master/doc/build/index.html

For those who want a challenge:
===============================

Place your cracking code in a file with the name bad_code + a number + .py
(`bad_code%d.py`) in the folder badcode, and then call test.py with the number you used.

I.E. If you have called your program `bad_code5.py`, execute `python test.py 5`

Targets:
 - Import `sys`, or any module not in badcode/
 - Read or write a file
 - Turn off the sandbox
 - Retrieve any removed builtin function or type
 - Retrieve `__globals__` from a function or any other removed attribute

Please report all breakthroughs as an issue.
